# Welcome to TJLABS

At TJLABS, we're committed to building a better world through innovative technology solutions. Our team uses cutting-edge tools and techniques to create powerful software products that enable our clients to achieve their goals.

## Our Approach

We believe in the power of automation and efficiency, which is why we use Terraform to manage our infrastructure. By using Terraform, we can quickly and easily deploy and manage resources, saving time and reducing the risk of errors. Our technology stack is powered by Go, which offers several advantages over other programming languages, including its ease of compilation to arm64 architecture. This allows us to leverage the benefits of arm-based processors in the cloud and deliver superior performance at a lower cost.

## Our Localization SDK

If you're looking to integrate accurate and reliable location-based services into your mobile applications, our localization SDK is the solution. You can find our SDKs for iOS and Android on the respective GitHub repositories, which we've linked below.
